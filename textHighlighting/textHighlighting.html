        A tree is a tall, woody plant with branches. Trees can survive for
        hundreds of years. The oldest tree discovered to date is around 5000
        years old. The oldest tree found in the United Kingdom is approximately
        1000 years old. The four essential components of a tree are the roots,
        trunk, branches, and leaves. A tree's roots are generally found beneath
        the earth. This is not always the case. The mangrove tree's beginnings
        are frequently underwater. A single tree has several roots. The roots
        transport nutrients and water from the ground to the tree's leaves via
        the trunk and branches. They can also inhale air. As with the banyan
        tree, roots can sometimes be specialized into aerial roots that can
        offer support. The trunk is the tree's primary body. The bark that
        covers the trunk protects it from injury. Branches sprout from the stem
        and spread out, allowing the leaves to get more sunlight. The leaves of
        a tree are typically green, although they can be a variety of colours,
        shapes, and sizes. The leaves absorb sunshine and use water and
        nourishment from the roots to develop and replicate the tree.
